# ðŸ§  TryHackMe Lab Tracker

Welcome! This is my personal cybersecurity lab journal where I track all my learning progress through TryHackMe and other platforms.

## ðŸ“… Weekly Updates
Iâ€™ll be posting a new lab summary every week as I learn more in topics like:
- SOC & Blue Team fundamentals
- Threat detection & analysis
- Windows & Linux basics
- Networking, SIEM, and more

## ðŸ“‚ Lab Files
Each room has its own `.md` file in the `/TryHackMe` folder with:
- Key takeaways
- Tools used
- Next steps

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Build consistent documentation habits
- Create a public record of my growth
- Improve skills for a future SOC Analyst role

Follow along as I level up every week.
